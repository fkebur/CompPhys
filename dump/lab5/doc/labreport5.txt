Are these plots qualitatively similar or different?
They are qualitatively different.
Looking at the ratio between branchings, I can see the Feigenbaum constant come out.

I did not time my program correctly so it did not fill all the way but the script should be able to fill out Part 2's bifurcation, given enough time.
