When we change the dt_factor value in "LaxAdvectionSolver1d_example.py" from 1 to 1.01 and 0.8, the results we see are caused by changes in the amplification factor. When increased to 1.01 the amplification factor itself will be greater than one and will amplify by definition. Although when decreased to 0.8, the time step results in a deamplification since the amplification will end up lower than one.
