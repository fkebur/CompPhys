Do/answer:

- solve BVP for 19.6 with both Jacobi/SOR

- set the convergence target so that the expected alg error is comparable with discretization error -- Basically answer the question: Has the iteration converged? if so, when? why/how

- explore SOR convergence -- Plot number of iterations needed vs omega for omega->(1.0-2.0)
answer this: Is the num recipes omega the optimal one? based on the plot.
"       "  : What is the speed-up of the SOR algorithm compared to Jacobi in terms of the number of iterations needed for convergence?

So for line 7 basically make a plot(x - omega,y - number of iters), observe if the convergence omega is good. then see when SOR starts to do better than Jacobi

I was not able to make sufficient conlcusions or plots from this lab.
