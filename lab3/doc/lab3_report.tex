\section{Part 1. Precision of Numerical Differentiation}
The slope of the plots inside each region agrees with my expectations. The region of decreasing slope is where the round-off error dominates. The region of increasing slope is where the approximation error dominates. At first the slope did not agree but after correcting the spacing of the range of h the slopes began to look like $\mathcal{O}(h)$ and $\mathcal{O}(h^2)$ respectively. The section~\ref{Plots} depicts the median relative error plots from attempting to take three first derivatives and one second derivative of the functions $exp(x)$, $ln(x+1)$, and $sin(2x)$ .
